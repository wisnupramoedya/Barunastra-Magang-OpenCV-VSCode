# Barunastra-Magang-OpenCV-VSCode
I made this so that someone could see my progress when I took an internship at Barunastra ITS. I used OpenCV with C++. It was really hard to find out how to use library OpenCV at VSCode.

## ALL OF THE DOCUMENTATION OF OPENCV IN VISUAL STUDIO CODE
Basic software:
```
- OpenCV 4.2.0
- Visual Studio Code
- Visual Studio 2017
```

- Installing with [OpenCV VSCODE](https://medium.com/@divyendu.narayan/opencv-c-setup-for-microsoft-visual-studio-2019-and-visual-studio-code-in-windows-64-bit-911b1c733b3e)
- Learning with [OpenCV Basic Tutorial](https://docs.opencv.org/2.4/doc/tutorials/tutorials.html)

## HOW TO OPEN THIS CODE WITH VSCODE
You need to open x64 Native
Add this:
1. cd C:\
2. E:
3. cd E:\Programming\"Proyek Coding"\OpenCV
